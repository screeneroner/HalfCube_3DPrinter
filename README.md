# HalfCube_3DPrinter

This repository is my notebook about creating a 3D printer entirely from scratch. It began as a hobby project aimed at learning FreeCAD, a 3D design CAD system. A 3D printer was chosen as a practical example to learn all of FreeCAD's features. However, once the design got its first shapes, I realized that it could be implemented in real hardware. It was a long journey, but now, I have my virtual printer realized in the real world. And now is the most exciting phase - bringing it to life, making it capable of printing real 3D models.

As I've discovered, I've gathered a significant amount of information that should be consolidated into a single storage to keep all details in one place. I'm fairly certain I'm not the only one on this journey, so I expect that my collection might be helpful to others following a similar path. 

However, the main goal is communication and seeking assistance from the community to answer the questions I currently have and undoubtedly will have more of in the future. For this reason, this repository will provide my interlocutors with the full context of my questions and the issues I am presently trying to resolve.

At this very moment I have this document(s):

- Hardware first launch: initial reviving of the printer's hardware MKS SKIPR printer board and MEAN WELL LRS-350-24 power supply unit. Headless process that even doesn't requires monitors to be connected.
